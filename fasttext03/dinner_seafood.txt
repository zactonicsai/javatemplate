Tonight's dinner was an elegant seafood feast featuring perfectly pan-seared salmon with a lemon butter sauce. The salmon had a crispy golden skin on the outside while remaining moist and flaky inside. As sides, I prepared steamed broccoli florets with a touch of garlic butter, and fluffy wild rice mixed with herbs. The meal was beautifully balanced with the omega-3 rich salmon providing healthy protein, the broccoli offering vitamins and minerals, and the wild rice giving complex carbohydrates for energy. I finished the plate with a wedge of fresh lemon and sprinkled chopped parsley on top. This restaurant-quality dinner was both nutritious and incredibly flavorful, showcasing how simple ingredients can create an impressive meal.
