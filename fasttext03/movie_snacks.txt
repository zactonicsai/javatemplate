For movie night, we prepared an array of delicious snacks to enjoy during the film. We popped fresh popcorn and seasoned it with butter and salt, filling a large bowl for sharing. I also made a batch of homemade trail mix combining roasted almonds, cashews, dried cranberries, chocolate chips, and coconut flakes. My roommate brought potato chips in several flavors - classic, barbecue, and sour cream and onion. We set out pretzel rods with a side of honey mustard for dipping. For healthier options, we sliced apples and celery, pairing them with creamy peanut butter. There were also granola bars, string cheese sticks, and rice cakes available for quick grab-and-go snacking. Everyone had their favorites, and the variety ensured no one went hungry during our three-hour movie marathon.
