For lunch today, I prepared a fresh garden salad loaded with colorful vegetables. I started with a base of crisp romaine lettuce and mixed greens, then added sliced cherry tomatoes, crunchy cucumber rounds, shredded carrots, and vibrant bell peppers in red and yellow. I topped the salad with grilled chicken breast for protein, sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese, and added a handful of seasoned croutons for crunch. To finish, I drizzled creamy ranch dressing over everything. This salad was not only delicious but also packed with nutrients from all the fresh vegetables, protein from the chicken, and dairy from the cheese. It's the perfect light yet satisfying midday meal.
