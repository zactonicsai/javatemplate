I went grocery shopping today and filled my cart with healthy foods from every section of the store. In the produce department, I selected fresh apples, bananas, strawberries, and a bag of mixed salad greens. I also grabbed broccoli, carrots, bell peppers, and tomatoes for the week's meals. Moving to the dairy section, I picked up milk, Greek yogurt, cheddar cheese, and butter. At the meat counter, I bought chicken breasts, ground beef, and fresh salmon fillets for my protein needs. I stopped by the bakery for whole wheat bread and grabbed brown rice, quinoa, and oatmeal from the grains aisle. For pantry staples, I added olive oil, soy sauce, ketchup, and mustard to my cart. Finally, I treated myself to some chocolate chip cookies and vanilla ice cream. The total came to a well-stocked week of nutritious and delicious foods.
