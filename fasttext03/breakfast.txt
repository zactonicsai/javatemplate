This morning I enjoyed a delicious breakfast with scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and buttered whole wheat toast. The eggs were fluffy and perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper. I paired it with a tall glass of fresh orange juice, rich in vitamin C and natural sweetness. To top it off, I had a bowl of fresh strawberries and blueberries on the side, which added a refreshing fruity element to the meal. The combination of protein from the eggs and bacon, grains from the toast, and vitamins from the juice and berries made for a well-balanced and satisfying start to my day.
