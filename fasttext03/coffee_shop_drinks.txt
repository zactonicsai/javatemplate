At the coffee shop this morning, I ordered my usual hot latte made with freshly brewed espresso and steamed whole milk, topped with beautiful latte art. My friend got an iced green tea with honey, which looked refreshing in its tall glass filled with ice. We also ordered fresh-squeezed orange juice for an extra vitamin boost. While waiting, we noticed they had smoothies on the menu, so we added a tropical mango smoothie to our order, blended with banana and coconut water. The barista also recommended their new kombucha on tap, a fermented tea with probiotic benefits. To complete our beverage experience, we grabbed bottles of sparkling water to stay hydrated throughout the day. The variety of drinks available really showcased both hot and cold options for every preference.
